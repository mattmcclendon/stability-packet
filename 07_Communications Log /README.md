# Communications Log

## Purpose

This folder records institutional interactions over time.

It exists to reconstruct timelines, reduce repetition, and preserve accountability.

---

## Scope

Materials may include:
- Call logs
- Email correspondence
- Case numbers and reference IDs
- Dates, agents, and stated outcomes
- Follow-up requirements or deadlines

---

## Governance

Entries are factual and minimal.  
This folder functions as a timeline, not commentary.

Consistency matters more than completeness.
