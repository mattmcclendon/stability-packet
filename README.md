# Stability Packet

## Purpose

This folder contains documentation related to personal, financial, legal, and identity stabilization efforts undertaken during a defined recovery and remediation period.

The Stability Packet exists to centralize records, establish continuity, and reduce cognitive load during periods of administrative complexity or institutional interaction.

It is a working archive, not a narrative.

## Scope

Materials in this folder may include, but are not limited to:

- Identity verification and remediation documents  
- Credit reporting agency records and disputes  
- Banking correspondence and account actions  
- Law enforcement reports related to fraud or identity theft  
- Healthcare coverage and eligibility documentation  
- Housing, benefits, or eligibility determinations  
- Regulatory, compliance, or audit-related records  

Documents are retained to support accuracy, verification, and accountability.

## Organization Principles

The Stability Packet follows these guiding principles:

1. **Single source of reference**  
   Wherever possible, authoritative copies live here to avoid fragmentation.

2. **Chronological clarity**  
   Dates are preserved explicitly to support reconstruction of events.

3. **Minimal interpretation**  
   Documents are stored as records, not arguments.

4. **Portability**  
   The packet is structured so it can be shared selectively with advocates, legal counsel, financial institutions, or agencies as needed.

---

## Naming Conventions

To preserve traceability and reduce ambiguity:

- Dates use `YYYY-MM-DD` format  
- Filenames describe the *document type*, not emotion or outcome  
- Versions increment only when substance changes  

**Example**  
`2025-12-29_FremontPD_IdentityTheftReport_T25005237.pdf`

## Governance

- This folder is private by default.  
- Contents may include sensitive or regulated information.  
- No document is removed without intent; superseded materials are retained for reference.  
- Summaries or interpretations, if required, live outside this folder.

---

## Intended Use

This packet is designed to:

- Support institutional review  
- Reduce repetition across agencies  
- Enable continuity across time, systems, and advocates  
- Protect clarity during periods of stress or transition  

It is not intended for publication.

## Status

This folder evolves as needed until stabilization objectives are met.  
Once resolved, materials may be archived intact for historical reference.

Stability is treated as an outcome, not a performance.
